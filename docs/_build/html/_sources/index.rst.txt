scikit-sound - Documentation
============================

*scikit-sound* is a library for working with sound files.

It is hosted under https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/scikit-sound, and
contains two modules:
:py:mod:`sounds` : utuilies for working with sound data
:py:mod:`misc` : utilities for file- and directory selection, and for user-interaction

The module :py:mod:`sounds` has two classes:

    - :py:class:`sounds.Sound` ... reading in, and working with sounds.
    - :py:class:`sounds.FFMPEG_info` ... handling the FFMPEG installation required for working with MP3-files etc.

The class *Sounds* lets you

    - :py:meth:`sounds.Sound.read_sound`  read in sounds from sound-files (WAV, etc).
    - :py:meth:`sounds.Sound.generate_sound` generate sounds from numpy arrays.
    - :py:meth:`sounds.Sound.play` play sounds
    - :py:meth:`sounds.Sound.get_info` show the corresponding information (sample rate, number of channels, etc.) 
    - :py:meth:`sounds.Sound.write_wav` write out sounds.

The class *FFMPEG_info* handles the detection of FFMPEG, and the
config-information for Python:

    The Python standard libraries and *scipy* provide good support for
    working with WAV files. If you also want to work with other file formats
    (MP3, AAC, etc), the easiest way is to install the open-source software
    *FFMPEG* on your computer. You can obtain *FFMPEG* for free from
    http://ffmpeg.org

    For more information, please check the help on the method *Sounds.sound()*

Installation
------------

The simplest way to install *sksound* is 

>>> pip install scikit-sound

For upgrading to the latest version of *sksound*, you have to type

>>> pip install scikit-sound -U

However, you can also install from the source files. To do this, just go to
the root directory of the package, and type

>>> python setup.py install

**Note**: After *sksound* is installed, I typically import it in
*Python* with:

>>> import sksound

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^
numpy, scipy, appdirs, pygame (only on Linux)

Testing
-------

The easiest way to test the package is with *unittest*. Open a terminal,
and type (on the command-line!):

>>> cd [_your_installation_dir_]\sksound\tests
>>> python -m unittest
